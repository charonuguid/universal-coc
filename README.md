# Universal Code of Conduct

_This `Code of Conduct` repository is experimental in nature. Use with caution._

## History

The creation of this repository came about after an incident with one of the online tech communities of which I am a co-moderator of. Generally, we'd just say "Be nice to each other". But some people need to be reminded what "nice" really means.

It was suggested that we finally have a `Code of Conduct` written up. But there is a problem with this. Quoting myself.

> CoC is nice *IF AND ONLY IF* it cannot be misinterpreted to be advantageous to only a few. Right now creating one can be very tricky. 
> I suppose we can put up a CoC on github, then PR for changes.

On further thought.

>  Sudden thought. I should experiment and see what happens to a universal CoC repo. See how everyone around the world contributes.

So here we go. This is an experiment based on the concept of __Universal Ethics__ applied to a Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This `Code of Conduct` targets tech communities and conferences.

## Basis

_Still looking for a `Code of Conduct` copy that can be used as base._

## How To Contribute
